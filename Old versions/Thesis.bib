Two scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research), the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I show that these collaboration networks form "small worlds," in which randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.},

   abstract = {Scientific breakthroughs for complex, large-scale problems require a combination of contributory expertize, disciplinary expertize, and interactional expertize, or socialized knowledge. There is, however, little formal recognition of what expertize is important for team success, and how to evaluate different types of contributions. This is problematic for the field of the Science of Team Sciences (SciTS). Funding is increasing for team science globally, but how do we know if teams are collaborating in meaningful ways to meet their goals? Many studies use bibliometric and citation data to understand team development and success; nevertheless, this type of data does not provide timely metrics about collaboration. This study asks: Can we determine if a team is collaborating and working together in meaningful ways in a process evaluation to achieve their goals and be successful in an outcome evaluation, and if so, how? This exploratory longitudinal, mixed-methods, case-based study, reports on eight interdisciplinary scientific teams that were studied from 2015–2017. The study used six different methods of data collection: a social network analysis at three-time points, participant observation, interviews, focus groups, turn-taking data during team meetings, and outcome metrics (publications, award dollars, etc.). After collecting and analyzing the data, a Kendall Rank Correlation was used to examine which development and process metrics correlated with traditional outcome metrics: publications, proposals submitted, and awards received. Five major implications, practical applications, and outputs arise from this case-based study: (1) Practicing even turn-taking is essential to team success. (2) The proportion of women on the team impacts the outcomes of the team. (3) Further evidence that successful team science is not about picking the right people, but on how to build the right team for success. (4) This article presents process metrics to increase understanding of successful and unsuccessful teams. (5) Teams need to engage in practices that build relationships for knowledge integration. This case-based study represents an early step to more effectively communicate how teams form and produce successful outcomes and increase their capacity for knowledge integration. The results contribute to the knowledge bank of integration and implementation by providing additional evidence about evaluation for scientific teams, including the know-how related to everyday interactions that lead to goal attainment. This study provides further evidence that to create new knowledge, scientific teams need both contributory and interactional expertize.},

Government-sponsored shared-cost programs are one of the premier mechanisms to foster such cooperation, yet little is known about the inner patterns of participation in such programs and whether they are conditional on specific resource needs that partners may have. In this article, I study the participation of organizations in projects seeking funds from the Cooperative Funding Initiative, a program sponsored by the Southwest Florida Water Management District that finances projects dealing with the management of water resources. Through the estimation of a series of Exponential Random Graph Models in the networks that form when organizations participate in projects (two-mode networks), I show that centralization around popular organizations results in greater bridging network capital, which facilitates the flow of nonoverlapping information from project to project. I analyze the implications of these findings and discuss how the formation of these bridging structures may enhance the capacity of the program to find innovative solutions to the problems the projects are designed to deal with. © 2014 Policy Studies Organization.},

Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas, suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline’s coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.},

In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and Fortune 1000 company directors. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network that is not captured by the random graph. © 2001 The American Physical Society.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

Evaluation committees often need to search in several repositories in order to deliver their evaluation summary report for an individual. However, it is extremely difficult to infer performance indicators that pertain to the evolution and the dynamics of a scholar. In this paper we propose a novel computational methodology based on unsupervised machine learning that can act as an important tool at the hands of evaluation committees of individual scholars. The suggested methodology compiles a list of several key performance indicators (features) for each scholar and monitors them over time. All these indicators are used in a clustering framework which groups the scholars into categories by automatically discovering the optimal number of clusters using clustering validity metrics. A profile of each scholar can then be inferred through the labeling of the clusters with the used performance indicators. These labels can ultimately act as the main profile characteristics of the individuals that belong to that cluster. Our empirical analysis gives emphasis on the “rising stars” who demonstrate the biggest improvement over time across all of the key performance indicators (KPIs), and can also be employed for the profiling of scholar groups.},

As a result, the complex phenomenon of scientific collaboration networks has been investigated within different approaches. Although the term "scientific collaboration network" has different connotations in the literature, we use the term more narrowly to focus on scientific collaboration resulting in co-authored public documents. We broaden this beyond journal articles to include many types of scientific productions in addition to journal articles and books. We insist that these productions are public items available in each field. In this chapter, we focus on the main quantitative approaches dealing with the structure and dynamics of scientific collaboration networks through co-authorized publications. We provide a brief history of social network analysis that serves as a foundation. We further review earlier conceptual classifications of co-authorship networks and distinguish cross-disciplinarily, cross-sectoral and cross-national levels. We couple the newer ideas of "small world" models and "preferential attachment" to older sociological conceptions of scientific collaboration. This is followed by descriptions of deterministic and stochastic models that have been used to study dynamic scientific collaboration networks. We stress the importance of delineating the topology of collaboration networks, understanding micro-level processes and then coupling them. We conclude by outlining the strengths and limitations of various modeling strategies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Scientists are increasingly charged with solving complex societal, health, and environmental problems. These systemic problems require teams of expert scientists to tackle research questions through collaboration, coordination, creation of shared terminology, and complex social and intellectual processes. Despite the essential need for such interdisciplinary interactions, little research has examined the impact of scientific team support measures like training, facilitation, team building, and expertise. The literature is clear that solving complex problems requires more than contributory expertise, expertise required to contribute to a field or discipline. It also requires interactional expertise, socialised knowledge that includes socialisation into the practices of an expert group. These forms of expertise are often tacit and therefore difficult to access, and studies about how they are intertwined are nearly non-existent. Most of the published work in this area utilises archival data analysis, not individual team behaviour and assessment. This study addresses the call of numerous studies to use mixed-methods and social network analysis to investigate scientific team formation and success. This longitudinal case-based study evaluates the following question: How are scientific productivity, advice, and mentoring networks intertwined on a successful interdisciplinary scientific team? This study used applied social network surveys, participant observation, focus groups, interviews, and historical social network data to assess this specific team and assessed processes and practices to train new scientists over a 15-year period. Four major implications arose from our analysis: (1) interactional expertise and contributory expertise are intertwined in the process of scientific discovery; (2) team size and interdisciplinary knowledge effectively and efficiently train early career scientists; (3) integration of teaching/training, research/discovery, and extension/engagement enhances outcomes; and, (4) interdisciplinary scientific progress benefits significantly when interpersonal relationships among scientists from diverse disciplines are formed. This case-based study increases understanding of the development and processes of an exemplary team and provides valuable insights about interactions that enhance scientific expertise to train interdisciplinary scientists.},

In particular, many complex challenges and opportunities require expertise and skills across disciplinary, organi-zational, and cultural boundaries. However, rapid growth in the demand for scientific collaboration has outpaced chan-ges in the factors needed to support scientific teams. Also, scientific results are not simply a combination of different working results; understanding how teams work and what causes them to fail or succeed is of the utmost importance. Thus, the Science of Team Science (SciTS), an emerging interdisciplinary research area, has emerged as a way of understanding and managing the circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of large-scale cross-disciplinary, collaborative research, training, and translational initiatives. SciTS integrates various quantitative and qualitative research methods and is still advancing in its sophistication. Using bibliometric and information visualization methods, this paper clarifies the concepts and connotations of teams and team science. It sets out important events in the emergence and development of SciTS and summarizes the characteristics of the SciTS literature, identifying seven main research areas. The paper concludes with a discussion on the challenges facing the future advancement of SciTS and corresponding recommendations for breaking through these bottlenecks. Our goal is to deepen researchers’ understanding of SciTS and better inform the policies and practices that govern SciTS for more effective team science.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate whether happiness can spread from person to person and whether niches of happiness form within social networks. Design: Longitudinal social network analysis. Setting: Framingham Heart Study social network. Participants: 4739 individuals followed from 1983 to 2003. Main outcome measures: Happiness measured with validated four item scale; broad array of attributes of social networks and diverse social ties. Results: Clusters of happy and unhappy people are visible in the network, and the relationship between people's happiness extends up to three degrees of separation (for example, to the friends of one's friends' friends). People whoare surrounded by many happy people and those who are central in the network are more likely to become happy in the future. Longitudinal statistical models suggest that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness and not just a tendency for people to associate with similar individuals. A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km)andwhobecomeshappy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25% (95% confidence interval 1% to 57%). Similar effects are seen in coresident spouses (8%, 0.2% to 16%), siblings who live within a mile (14%, 1% to 28%), and next door neighbours (34%, 7% to 70%). Effects are not seen between coworkers. The effect decays with time and with geographical separation. Conclusions: People's happiness depends on the happiness of others with whom they are connected. This provides further justification for seeing happiness, like health, as a collective phenomenon.},

The facilitation of information exchange may be supported and influenced by persons in key positions. Within these networks, centralized actors often control the flow and access to information. We take a descriptive approach to explore the relationship between fishing role and actor prominence within information-sharing networks in Jamaica. We hypothesized that fishing captains – given their perceived legitimacy and formal and informal authority – would be more prominent in information-sharing networks, and the information they shared would be perceived as more trustworthy and influential than that of non-captains. We collected personal social networks of fishers (n = 353) on 20 fishing beaches across four parishes in Jamaica using structured questionnaires. We found low centralization and density scores across the parishes, suggesting an even distribution of actor centrality. Our results show that non-captains play a more prominent role in information sharing than fishing captains in one parish suggesting that captains and non-captains play similar roles in facilitating information, and that differences lie in whether fishers perceive the shared information as trustworthy and influential in their fishing decisions and not the prominence of the actor. These findings contribute to understanding the various adaptive strategies fishers develop to meet growing social-ecological changes in small-scale fisheries. Identifying key informants in prominent positions can also support the development of more effective strategies to communicate and share information across communities.},

Research recognizes that faculty social networks regarding discussion or advice about teaching may matter to such efforts. But teaching is not the only priority for university faculty – meeting research expectations is at least as important and, often, more consequential for tenure and promotion decisions. We see value in understanding how research networks, based on discussion and advice about research matters, relate to teaching networks to see if and how such networks could advance instructional reform efforts. Our research examines data from three departments (biology, chemistry, and geosciences) at three universities that had recently received funding to enhance adoption of EBIPs in STEM fields. We evaluate exponential random graph models of the teaching network and find that (a) the existence of a research tie from one faculty member <inline-formula> <alternatives> <tex-math>$$i$$</tex-math> <math> <mi>i</mi> </math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> to another <inline-formula> <alternatives> <tex-math>$$j$$</tex-math> <math> <mi>j</mi> </math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> enhances the prospects of a teaching tie from <inline-formula> <alternatives> <tex-math>$$i$$</tex-math> <math> <mi>i</mi> </math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> to <inline-formula> <alternatives> <tex-math>$$j$$</tex-math> <math> <mi>j</mi> </math> </alternatives> </inline-formula> , but (b) even though faculty highly placed in the teaching network are more likely to be extensive EBIP users, faculty highly placed in the research network are not, dimming prospects for leveraging research networks to advance STEM instructional reforms. </p>},

   abstract = {This paper explores the application of network intervention strategies to the problem of assembling cross-disciplinary scientific teams in academic institutions. In a project supported by the University of Florida (UF) Clinical and Translational Science Institute, we used VIVO, a semantic-web research networking system, to extract the social network of scientific collaborations on publications and awarded grants across all UF colleges and departments. Drawing on the notion of network interventions, we designed an alteration program to add specific edges to the collaboration network, that is, to create specific collaborations between previously unconnected investigators. The missing collaborative links were identified by a number of network criteria to enhance desirable structural properties of individual positions or the network as a whole. We subsequently implemented an online survey (N = 103) that introduced the potential collaborators to each other through their VIVO profiles, and investigated their attitudes toward starting a project together. We discuss the design of the intervention program, the network criteria adopted, and preliminary survey results. The results provide insight into the feasibility of intervention programs on scientific collaboration networks, as well as suggestions on the implementation of such programs to assemble cross-disciplinary scientific teams in CTSA institutions.},

   abstract = {A growing body of evidence shows that collaborative teams and communities tend to produce the highest-impact scientific work. This paper proposes a new method to (1) Identify collaborative communities in longitudinal scientific networks, and (2) Evaluate the impact of specific research institutes, services or policies on the interdisciplinary collaboration between these communities. First, we apply community-detection algorithms to cross-sectional scientific collaboration networks and analyze different types of co-membership in the resulting subgroups over time. This analysis summarizes large amounts of longitudinal network data to extract sets of research communities whose members have consistently collaborated or shared collaborators over time. Second, we construct networks of cross-community interactions and estimate Exponential Random Graph Models to predict the formation of interdisciplinary collaborations between different communities. The method is applied to longitudinal data on publication and grant collaborations at the University of Florida. Results show that similar institutional affiliation, spatial proximity, transitivity effects, and use of the same research services predict higher degree of interdisciplinary collaboration between research communities. Our application also illustrates how the identification of research communities in longitudinal data and the analysis of cross-community network formation can be used to measure the growth of interdisciplinary team science at a research university, and to evaluate its association with research policies, services or institutes.},

boundaries. Previous studies have retroactively examined the emergence of these fields. This paper outlines a mixed 
method approach for using network ethnography to identify emerging fields as they develop, track their evolution over 
time, and increase collaboration on these topics. This approach allowed us to simultaneously analyze organizational 
trends and gain an understanding of why these patterns occurred. Collecting ethnographic data throughout the course of 
the study enabled us to iteratively improve the fit of our models. It also helped us design an experimental method for 
creating new teams in these fields and test the effectiveness of this intervention. Initially, organizational leaders were wary 
of using a network intervention to alter these fields. However, by presenting insights from both our network analysis and 
ethnographic fieldwork, we were able to demonstrate the strategic need and potential impact of this type of intervention. 
We believe that network ethnography can be applied in many other research contexts to help build strategic partnerships, 
facilitative organizational change, and track industry trends.},

However, no paper addresses the relation between authors' research domains and personal impact factors (PIF) with the ordering of author names. We aimed to apply Gini coefficient (GC) to evaluate the author research domains associated with the PIF and the ordering of author names on academic papers. Methods: By searching the PubMed database (Pubmed.com), we used the keyword “medicine” [journal] and downloaded 10,854 articles published from 1969 to 2018. A total number of 7502 articles labeled with complete author's countries/areas were included in data analysis. We also proposed a PIF index and jointly applied social network analysis (SNA), the GC, and Google Maps to report the following data with visual representations: the trend of author collaboration in Medicine; the dominant nations and keywords in Medicine; and the author research domains in Medicine associated with the PIF and the ordering of author names on academic papers. Results: The trend of author collaboration in Medicine is slightly declining (= 0.06) based on the number of authors per article. The mean number of individuals listed as authors in articles is 7.5. Most first authors are from China (3649, 48.64%) and Taiwan (847, 11.29%). The median of GC (0.32) and PIF (0.74) for the middle authors are obviously less than those for the first (0.53, 2.19) and the last authors (0.42, 2.61). A perfect positive linear relation with a large effect exists between GC and PIF because the correlation coefficient is 0.68 (>0.50, t = 2.48, n = 9).},

Using Rao-Stirling (RS) Diversity sometimes produces anomalous results. We argue that these unexpected outcomes can be related to the use of "dual-concept diversity" which combines "variety" and "balance" in the definitions (ex ante). We propose to modify RS Diversity into a new indicator (DIV) which operationalizes "variety," "balance," and "disparity" independently and then combines them ex post. "Bal-ance" can be measured using the Gini coefficient. We apply DIV to the aggregated citation patterns of 11,487 journals covered by the Journal Citation Reports 2016 of the Science Citation Index and the Social Sciences Citation Index as an empirical domain and, in more detail, to the citation patterns of 85 journals assigned to the Web-of-Science category "information science & library science" in both the cited and citing directions. We compare the results of the indicators and show that DIV provides improved results in terms of distinguishing between interdisciplinary knowledge integration (citing references) versus knowledge diffusion (cited impact). The new diversity indicator and RS diversity measure different features. A routine for the measurement of the various operationalization of diversity (in any data matrix) is made available online.},

Despite the numerous papers that discussed the ordering of author names and the contributions of authors to an article, no paper evaluated (1) the research achievement (RA) and (2) the research domain (RD) for productive sole-author researchers. In addition, few researchers publish academic articles without co-author collaboration. Whether the bibliometric indexes (eg, h-/x-index) of sole-author researchers are higher than those of other types of multiple authors is required for comparison. We aimed to evaluate a productive author who published 114 sole-author articles with exceptional RA and RD in academics. Methods: By searching the PubMed database (Pubmed.com), we used the keyword of (Taiwan[affiliation]) from 2016 to 2017 and downloaded 29,356 articles. One physician (Dr. Tseng from the field of Internal Medicine) who published 12 articles as a single author was selected. His articles and citations were searched in PubMed. A comparison of various types of author ordering placements was conducted using sensitivity analysis to inspect whether this sole author earns the highest metrics in RA. Social network analysis (SNA), Gini coefficient (GC), pyramid plot, and the Kano diagram were applied to gather the following data for visualization: (1) the author collaborations and RA using x-index; (2) the author's article-related journals frequently published in the past; (3) the most influential medical subject heading (MeSH) using citation analysis to denote the author's RD. Results: We observed that (1) DR Tseng contributed 114 sole-author articles in 140 publications (=81.4%) since 2002; (2) the 100% sole-author scenario earned the highest h-/x-index; (3) the author's RD includes epidemiology, complications, and metabolism with an exceptional GC (=0.55). Conclusions: The metrics on RA are high for the sole author studied. The author's RD can be denoted by the MeSH terms and measured by the GC. The author-weighted scheme is required for quantifying author credits in an article to evaluate the author's RA. Social network analysis incorporating the Kano diagrams provided insights into the relationships between actors (eg, coauthors, MeSH terms, or journals). The methods used in this study can be replicated to evaluate other productive studies on RA and RD in the future.

These networks could be studied through social networks analysis and data mining techniques. The focus of the article is twofold: the first objective is the analysis of the co-authorship networks of the top 60 countries that had the highest number of scientific publications in the world, and the second one is the discovery of collaboration patterns of highly cited papers of these countries. To do so, all scientific publications of the top 60 countries in all fields as well as their highly cited papers were included in the study period between 2011 and 2015. The research samples in the first part included 10,460,999 documents and in the second part encompassed 711,025 highly cited papers. Required data were extracted from web of science database. To analyse co-authorship networks, centrality indices and clustering coefficient were used. UCINET, Pajek, VOSviewer and BibExcel software were used to map co-authorship networks of the countries and to calculate indices. Finally, the discovery of collaboration patterns in highly cited papers is studied through association rules. The research data indicated that over 95% of documents has been produced by the top 60 countries. In addition, the USA, Germany, England, France and Spain launched the most co-authorship. Quantitatively, there have been the most powerful collaboration links between China and the USA, the USA and England, the USA and Germany, and the USA and Canada. The clustering data indicated that collaborations of the top countries of the world were in three main clusters. The Friedman test showed that there was a significant difference in the priorities of the countries for collaboration; and the USA, China, England, Germany, France, Japan and Italy are in the top priority for collaboration, respectively. The results of collaboration pattern in highly cited papers indicated that the USA participates in more than half of collaboration patterns for producing highly cited papers.},

   abstract = {<p>Social scientists have long appreciated that relationships between individuals cannot be described from observing a single domain, and that the structure across domains of interaction can have important effects on outcomes of interest (e.g., cooperation; Durkheim, 1893). One debate explicitly about this surrounds food sharing. Some argue that failing to find reciprocal food sharing means that some process other than reciprocity must be occurring, whereas others argue for models that allow reciprocity to span domains in the form of trade (Kaplan and Hill, 1985.). Multilayer networks, high‐dimensional networks that allow us to consider multiple sets of relationships at the same time, are ubiquitous and have consequences, so processes giving rise to them are important social phenomena. The analysis of multi‐dimensional social networks has recently garnered the attention of the network science community (Kivelä et al., 2014). Recent models of these processes show how ignoring layer interdependencies can lead one to miss why a layer formed the way it did, and/or draw erroneous conclusions (Górski et al., 2018). Understanding the structuring processes that underlie multiplex networks will help understand increasingly rich data sets, giving more accurate and complete pictures of social interactions.</p>},

Specifically, it is proposed to model the weighted network connectivity structure using a hierarchical multilayer exponential random graph model (ERGM) generative process where each network layer represents a different ordinal dyadic category. The network layers are assumed to be generated by an ERGM process conditional on their closest lower network layers. A crucial advantage of the proposed method is the possibility of adopting the binary network statistics specification to describe both the between-layer and across-layer network processes and thus facilitating the interpretation of the parameter estimates associated to the network effects included in the model. The Bayesian approach provides a natural way to quantify the uncertainty associated to the model parameters. From a computational point of view, an extension of the approximate exchange algorithm is proposed to sample from the doubly-intractable parameter posterior distribution. A simulation study is carried out on artificial data and applications of the methodology are illustrated on well-known datasets. Finally, a goodness-of-fit diagnostic procedure for model assessment is proposed.},

   abstract = {We consider the problem of Heider balance in a link multiplex, i.e. a special multiplex where coupling exists only between corresponding links. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations demonstrate that the presence of such interlayer connections hinders the emergence of the Heider balance. The effect is especially pronounced when the interactions between layers are negative, similarly as in antiferromagnetically coupled spin layers. The larger is the network, the narrower is the region of coupling parameters where the Heider balance can exist. If the interlayer couplings are of opposite signs and are strong enough, then the link dynamics can be reduced to the system of weakly coupled harmonic oscillators. For large strongly-coupled networks and randomly chosen initial conditions the probability of attaining the Heider balance decreases with the network size N as 2-N22. Our finding can explain a lack of the Heider balance in many social systems, where multilayer structures mediate social interactions.},

   abstract = {Nodes in a complex networked system often engage in more than one type of interactions among them; they form a multiplex network with multiple types of links. In real-world complex systems, a node's degree for one type of links and that for the other are not randomly distributed but correlated, which we term correlated multiplexity. In this paper, we study a simple model of multiplex random networks and demonstrate that the correlated multiplexity can drastically affect the properties of a giant component in the network. Specifically, when the degrees of a node for different interactions in a duplex Erdo″s-Rényi network are maximally correlated, the network contains the giant component for any nonzero link density. In contrast, when the degrees of a node are maximally anti-correlated, the emergence of the giant component is significantly delayed, yet the entire network becomes connected into a single component at a finite link density. We also discuss the mixing patterns and the cases with imperfect correlated multiplexity. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Tree graphs, concept mapping, and member checking are applied in a managerial case study, complementing a conventional grounded theory approach. Findings The paper suggests that naturalistic inquiries, such as grounded theory and thematic analysis, can use mixed methods and multiple sources and coders in order to offset biases and to validate and sort findings. The case study presents three different perspectives on how an organization comprehends diversity as a strategic issue. Originality/value The paper suggests a mixed methods design that addresses some of the potential shortcomings often found in grounded theory and other qualitative studies, their theory development and their documentation of processes.

   abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to expand the use of ethnography to advance research on team science by revealing the barriers to teamwork as manifesting at institutional, cultural, and interpersonal contextual scales. The analysis suggests strategies to enhance team science's collaborative potential. Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers some of the practical and analytical challenges of team science through the use of ethnographic methods. The authors formed a three-person subteam within a larger multisited, federally-funded, interdisciplinary scientific team. The authors conducted six months of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and a focus group, using iterative deductive and inductive analyses to investigate the larger team's roles, relationships, dynamics, and tensions. Findings: Integrating ethnography into the study of team science can uncover and mitigate barriers faced by teams at three primary levels: (1) academic culture, (2) institutional structures, and (3) interpersonal dynamics. The authors found that these three contextual factors are often taken for granted and hidden in the team science process as well as that they are interactive and influence teams at multiple scales of analysis. These outcomes are closely related to how team science is funded and implemented in academic and institutional settings. Originality/value: As US federal funding initiatives continue to require scientific collaboration via inter-, multi-, and transdisciplinary research, there is little work done on how teams grapple with the practical tensions of scientific teamwork. This paper identifies and addresses many practical tensions and contextual factors across institutional and organizational structures that affect and challenge the conduct of collaborative scientific teamwork. The authors also argue that ethnography can be a method to challenge myths, understand contextual factors, and improve the goals of team science.},

What is often called the practice-turn, however, has not reached research on interorganizational networks. This is mainly due to methodological issues that call, in the end, for a mixed-method approach. This article addresses this issue by proposing a research design that balances well-established social network analysis with a set of techniques of organizational ethnography that fit with the specifics of interorganizational networks. In what we call network ethnography, qualitative and quantitative data are collected and analyzed in a parallel fashion. Ultimately, the design implies convergence during data interpretation, hereby offering platforms of reflection for each method toward new data collection and analysis.

We suggest that the structures revealed indicate overlapping subcommunities within a research specialty, and we provide evidence that they differ in disciplinary orientation and research practices. By mapping the community structures of scientific fields we increase confidence about the domain of validity of ethnographic observations as well as of collaborative patterns extracted from publication networks thereby enabling the systematic study of field differences. The network analytic methods presented include methods to optimize the delineation of a bibliographic data set to adequately represent a research specialty and methods to extract community structures from this data.

   abstract = {Collaborative research has become increasingly prominent since the mid-20th century. This article aspires to offer a fundamental ontology of a multidisciplinary research system. As a point of departure, we consider disciplinarity as a restricted language code as noted by Bernstein. The impetus for collaboration is found in a research problem’s transcendence of disciplinary bounds. This article makes several propositions that diverge from the consensus position regarding the formation and dynamics of a multidisciplinary system. Most notably that such a system adheres to the constituent elements of what could be regarded as a complex system, including an ensemble of elements, interactions between these elements, local disorder followed by the emergence of robust order and system memory. We propose that the internal communications and subsequent self-organization of such a system may be conceptualized as orientation signals, or ‘stigmergy’, analogous to those observed in swarms. System robustness, we argue, is a function of the individual researcher’s local autonomy and is, paradoxically, augmented by the weakness of communications across disciplinary bounds, along with the lack of central organization and the emphasis on research novelty. System memory, we argue, manifests itself in the ability of a researcher to change her/his route of inquiry, based on environmental feedback, whereby new information becomes incorporated into the adjusted research methodology. We propose that an emergent intelligence, at the level of the system, expresses itself in the unconcealment of the ‘form’ of the metaproblem. The theoretical model is empirically illustrated using, as an example, the contemporary field of renewable energy research, which is an area primed for collaborative research. It is anticipated that an improved understanding of multidisciplinary research systems provides insights into certain strengths particular to less integrated and self-organized forms of collaborative research along with a framework with which to improve the design and fostering of such systems.},

   abstract = {Notwithstanding the rapidly growing body of literature on interdisciplinary research, several of the crucial dynamics in interdisciplinary research systems remain poorly understood and undertheorized. To this effect we seek to provide a ‘fundamental’ ontology of interdisciplinary research systems. We principally understand an interdisciplinary research system as a complex system consisting of researchers from different disciplines that have undergone a pseudomorphosis (i.e. a false formation) into a complicated system through the formation of a central organizing principle. The central organizing principle provides a stricter definition of the research problem and subsequently coalesces the intentionality of system agents through a unification of their disparate aims and methodologies. This pseudomorphosis is thereby associated with an exchange of individual freedom for organizational utility resulting in internal tensions which are, we argue, most prominently expressed in the interplay of epistemic incompatibilities between disciplines. We explore three frameworks for successfully navigating these incompatibilities: circumvention, which is based on avoidance of areas of disciplinary incompatibility; pragmatism, which is based on ignoring areas of compatibility; and disciplinary synthesis which involves a paradigm shift in researchers’ understanding of their disciplinary propositions resolving perceived incompatibilities. It is anticipated that this paper may be of benefit to researchers and organizers seeking to effectively structure interdisciplinary research projects, specifically in terms of framing the research problem and the modes of inquiry, and in structuring the interdisciplinary research team.},

RATIONALE To better seek, see and enable growth, we take a holistic approach to team prosperity and overall success. One aspect of this approach develops investigators as leaders, allowing us to "invest in the future investors". Alongside research leadership development, we work with team conceptualization and development (team science) through to a project/proposal vision and plan, culminating in strong teams with a clear vision for science and interpersonal pathways enhancing proposal and award outcomes. In the current model for development and award, we invest in proposals by taking time to work with individuals and teams to assist in getting them over the finish line. This could mean a successful stair step toward greater funding and scientific advancement, or it could mean a significant award followed by a long-term plateau in advancing knowledge. If a PI is comfortable in how their research enterprise operates, there may not be reason to build further. If we want to sustainably accelerate funding opportunities and team advancement, however, we must create opportunities to ask the PIs and their team "what do you need now?" and through leadership, visioning, and team science work empower individuals with the skills and tools be able to answer in an actionable way. STRUCTURE In this pilot we will invest in consultant, Divergent Science (see Bios in Appendix A), to work through an academic year of training and engagement resulting in development for the pilot teams involved and training for the Center for Research and Creative Activity (CRCA) staff. This model is regenerative though faculty input over cohorts. i.e., learn it and then teach it. And could/will include a mechanism for successful teams/PIs to mentor future teams/cohorts, as well.

   abstract = {In this article, we use newly developed statistical methods to examine the generative processes that give rise to widespread patterns in friendship networks. The methods incorporate both traditional demographic measures on individuals (age, sex, and race) and network measures for structural processes operating on individual, dyadic, and triadic levels. We apply the methods to adolescent friendship networks in 59 U.S. schools from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We model friendship formation as a selection process constrained by individuals' sociality (propensity to make friends), selective mixing in dyads (friendships within race, grade, or sex categories are differentially likely relative to cross-category friendships), and closure in triads (a friend's friends are more likely to become friends), given local population composition. Blacks are generally the most cohesive racial category, although when whites are in the minority, they display stronger selective mixing than do blacks when blacks are in the minority. Hispanics exhibit disassortative selective mixing under certain circumstances; in other cases, they exhibit assortative mixing but lack the higher-order cohesion common in other groups. Grade levels are always highly cohesive, while females form triangles more than males. We conclude with a discussion of how network analysis may contribute to our understanding of sociodemographic structure and the processes that create it. he structure of social relations in a population emerges from both the distribution of personal attributes and the dynamics of interaction. For example, the frequency of inter-racial marriage refl ects both the proportion of a population within each race and the norms infl uencing selection of marriage partners. When individuals can have multiple partners (e.g., friendships), the partnerships may be interdependent, generating complex social network structures. These population-level structures channel the spread of information, norms, disease, support, and other socially exchanged goods. The fl ow of such entities can in turn generate behavioral change in individuals and demographic change in populations. A long line of research has examined the infl uence of social networks on individuals' demographic attributes and behaviors: fertility decline and contraception use},

   abstract = {Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are a well-established family of statistical models for analyzing social networks. Computational complexity has so far limited the appeal of ERGMs for the analysis of large social networks. Efficient computational methods are highly desirable in order to extend the empirical scope of ERGMs. In this paper we report results of a research project on the development of snowball sampling methods for ERGMs. We propose an auxiliary parameter Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for sampling from the relevant probability distributions. The method is designed to decrease the number of allowed network states without worsening the mixing of the Markov chains, and suggests a new approach for the developments of MCMC samplers for ERGMs. We demonstrate the method on both simulated and actual (empirical) network data and show that it reduces CPU time for parameter estimation by an order of magnitude compared to current MCMC methods.},

@article{Lyall2013,
   abstract = {Research funding agencies in many countries support interdisciplinary collaboration in order to tackle the 'grand challenges' facing societies worldwide but there is uneven guidance as to its effective conduct. Different types of interdisciplinarity require different approaches and there is no single model for success. Moreover, 'problem-solving interdisciplinarity' often runs contrary to academic conventions, structures and norms which are still predominantly discipline-based. The stability offered by public investment over the longer term may offer advantages for the personal research and publication strategies of interdisciplinary researchers. Support for relationship building with a range of stakeholders through this type of research may also lead to a greater likelihood of research impact beyond the academy. The benefits of such experiments in research capacity-building can be both intellectually rewarding and confer added value to public investments by encouraging significant social and economic returns.},

@article{Lyall2013funding,
   abstract = {The relationship between disciplines is strongly influenced by national funding agencies and a great deal of tacit knowledge about the management of interdisciplinary research programmes and projects is held by such bodies. Funders' support is critical to achieving the potential value-added of interdisciplinarity and these agencies have key roles to play, especially in shaping large-scale interdisciplinary initiatives. This paper reports on an empirical study and offers some lessons for public policy aimed at promoting learning and generating benefits that are broadly applicable across future efforts to tackle complex, multi-dimensional research challenges. There are key practical organisational steps that could be taken to promote and support collaborative working and integration for large-scale interdisciplinary research initiatives. Awareness of these critical processes can benefit funders as well as practitioners if interdiscip-linary research is to achieve its full potential.},

@article{Bolger2021,
   abstract = {It has long been argued that solutions to inform better decisions on environmental challenges require research at the boundaries of scientific disciplines. Research institutes and centers at universities can be key vehicles for the convergence of scientists from multiple disciplines and the development of integrated, interdisciplinary knowledge. Through a survey of over two hundred faculty in three sustainability research institutes based in the USA, this study explored faculty perceptions of interdisciplinary research, their levels of engagement in interdisciplinary work, and how they view the role of the research institute in enabling interdisciplinary research. The investigation shows that over 95% of faculty at the institutes studied are carrying out research with colleagues outside their own discipline, with half of the faculty spending more than two-thirds of their time on interdisciplinary work. Over half of faculty members are engaging in long-distance interdisciplinary research across the natural-social sciences boundary which is seen as crucial for sustainability science. The research institutes are having a positive influence on facilitating interdisciplinarity with more than four out of five faculty indicating that the institute has enabled interdisciplinary research opportunities that would have not have been possible in their home school. The opportunity to engage in interdisciplinary research is among the most important reasons for faculty to join institutes. While limited to three institutes, the study provides robust evidence for the powerfully beneficial role that research institutes can play as enablers on interdisciplinary research within their university.},
